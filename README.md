# Bank-Marketing-ML-Analysis
A Machine Learning project analyzing the Bank Marketing dataset to predict client subscription to term deposits. Implements Neural Networks and Random Forests with hyperparameter tuning, ROC curve analysis, and model evaluation. Part of university coursework for predictive analytics and AI.

Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (binary classification) using data from a Portuguese bank's marketing campaigns. The project explores various machine learning models, evaluates their performance, and compares results to identify the most effective approach.

following models were used in this project,

1. Neural network model
2. Random forest classification
